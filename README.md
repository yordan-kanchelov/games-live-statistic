# typescript-library-template

Starter kit with zero-config for building a library in TypeScript, featuring RollupJS, Jest, Prettier, Standard-version, and more!

## Heavily inspired from of @alexjoverm [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter)

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkanchelov/typescript-library-starter.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME

# Run npm install and write your library name when asked. That's all!
npm install
```

**Start coding!** `package.json` and entry files are already set up for you, so don't worry about linking to your main file, typings, etc. Just keep those files with the same name.

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

### NPM scripts

-   `npm test`: Run test suite
-   `npm start`: Run `npm run build`in watch mode
-   `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
-   `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
-   `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
-   `npm run lint`: Lints code
-   `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)
-   `npm run release`: Calls [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), bumping the package version, creating / updating the CHANGELOG.md and creating a tag for your repo.

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.
